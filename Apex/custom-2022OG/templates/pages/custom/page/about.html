									<h3>3,500 BC</h3>
									<p>We know that humans have been wearing closed-toe shoes for over 5,500 years because in 2010, this remarkably well-preserved shoe was discovered in Armenia and dates to 3,500 BC. Back then, there was only one
										reason to own a pair
										of shoes – protection.</p>

									<h3>1946</h3>
									<h4>Fast forward a few thousand years to 1946</h4>
									<p>In 1946, protection was, and still is, the most important reason to own a pair of shoes. Unfortunately, by the modern, most of us had migrated away from the concept of 'shoes for protection' to a style-first
										mentality. Not
										that style is unimportant or shallow - at Apex we thrive on style! - but when style supersedes concepts like protection, support, fit, and manufacturing expertise, feet begin to hurt. And worse.</p>
									<p>Which brings us back to 1946 and two gentlemen named Paul and Charles Schwartz. The Schwartz brothers founded Apex in the backroom of a Manhattan shoe store where they manufactured leather and stainless-steel
										arch supports (such
										supports evolved to become known as 'foot orthotics'), components for shoe repair as well as certain shoe-related raw materials.</p>

									<h3>1966-1971</h3>
									<p>The torch was eventually passed to Paul's son, Richard Schwartz, who expanded the line to include 'therapeutic' shoes. That's where the story gets really interesting. Why? Because for shoes to qualify as
										therapeutic, they have
										to check certain boxes that make them ideal not just for people with serious foot conditions like those typically associated with diabetes and arthritis, but for anyone with feet. More on that later. In the
										meantime...</p>
									<p>Apex introduced its first shoe in 1971. Nearing its 50th anniversary, the model 1201 was known as 'the healing shoe' and for good reason. The 1201 upper is made of stretchable Spandex® and was designed to
										accommodate a variety
										of injuries and other foot conditions where pain and swelling can make a foot's life extremely difficult and uncomfortable.</p>

									<h3>1999</h3>
									<p>By the late 1990s, having firmly established itself as the most respected and successful therapeutic footware company in America, Apex developed and launched its first athletic shoe. With the X521, the company
										was well on its
										way to revolutionizing the 'medical' shoe industry.</p>
									<p>With the new millennium came a growing awareness and appreciation for health as lifestyle. The cost of healthcare had been sky-rocketing for decades and Americans of all ages and socio-economic groups were
										feeling the effect.
										Insurance was more and more expensive, plans increasingly complicated and restrictive and appointments harder to get. It made sense, then, that Health and Wellness was on the minds of many. An apple a day was no
										longer enough
										to keep the doctor away.</p>
									<p>Of course, Health and Wellness had been the driving force behind Apex Foot Health products for over half a century. The rest of the world was finally catching up!</p>

									<h4>Enter OHI.</h4>
									<p>In March of 2015, a company whose products and services were helping many millions of people live healthier, happier lives added Apex to its family of brands. The leadership at OHI had long respected the
										Schwartz family and how

										full bloom across
