                    <h2>Because one style doesn’t fit all.</h2>
                    <p>You deserve a pair of shoes that are not only stylish and comfortable, but also engineered to
                        support the unique biomechanics of your feet. With 26 bones and 33 joints – all of which must
                        work together to support your body weight when you move around – the foot and ankle is a very
                        complex structure. Given this complexity, we believe that taking a one-style-fits-all approach
                        to shoe design isn't a healthy approach. </p>
                    <p>That’s why we developed X-Last, V-Last and A-Last technologies: three different approaches to
                        shoe design and construction that are engineered to help you move about the world in the most
                        comfortable, efficient way.</p>
                    <h2>Which style is right for you?</h2>
                    <p>Determining which of these technologies is right for you depends on how much your foot pronates when walking. Pronation is the natural outside-in motion of the foot that begins when the outside edge of the heel strikes the ground and ends when you push off with the big toe. Overpronation can lead to conditions like Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, shin splints and even knee or back pain. To prevent these conditions, the shoes and orthotic inserts you choose should be designed for your level of pronation. That’s why Apex is the go-to footwear brand for so many health-conscious consumers.  </p>

With X-Last shoes, a molded external heel counter that extends around the heel to the arch works in conjunction with an internal heel counter to provide superior motion control and maintain the foot in a neutral position during each step.</p>
