                    <p>After a long day of work as a middle school librarian, Phyllis always looked forward to coming
                        home, kicking off her shoes and relaxing.</p>
                    <p>Except she couldn't relax – her feet were in too much pain.</p>
                    <p>Like many people her age, <strong>Phyllis suffered from plantar fasciitis, one of the most common
                            causes of heel and foot pain.</strong>
                        And while she seemed to do well during the day when she could wear a pair of supportive shoes
                        with orthotic inserts,
                        <strong>things seemed to fall apart each evening when she took her shoes off and walked around
                            the house barefooted.</strong>

                    <h2>When Going Barefoot is a Pain</h2>
                    <p>Plantar fasciitis or heel pain is caused when the arch doesn’t receive enough support and
                        collapses. When this happens, the bundle of tendons, ligaments and muscles that make up the arch
                        are stretched to an unnatural position, causing pain at the heel.</p>
                    <p>Typically, improper footwear or worn out footwear are the most likely culprits.</p>
                    <p>The cruel irony of it all is that <strong>even though plantar fasciitis or heel pain can be
                            caused by the wrong pair of shoes, skipping shoes altogether and going barefoot in the
                            evening can make matters worse.</strong>
                        That’s because you’re switching from wearing shoes that provide poor support for the arches to
                        wearing nothing, which provides zero support.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the experts at <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/what-quarantine-is-doing-to-your-feet.html" target="_blank">Cedars-Sinai</a> and the <a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/tr5853" target="_blank">University of
                            Michigan</a> both say that <strong>going barefoot can make the pain worse.</strong>
                        The University of Michigan even goes so far as to recommend putting on “your shoes as soon as
                        you get out of bed” in the morning to avoid the pain.</p>
                    <p>Which is a shame for people, like Phyllis, who are dealing with plantar fasciitis, because it’s
                        hard to feel like you’re relaxing at home when you have to choose between
                        keeping your shoes on (and presumably off the furniture) or having feet that hurt.
                        <strong>Putting on a pair of shoes first thing after you wake up? There has to be a better
                            solution.</strong></p>

                    <h2>What About Slippers?</h2>
                    <p>That’s good question, and it’s what Phyllis wondered one evening as she was vacuuming up grass
                        she had accidently tracked into her bedroom with her shoes.</p>
                    <p>After all, wearing a slipper must be better than wearing nothing, right?</p>
                    <p>Not really. <strong>Slippers generally aren’t made to provide much arch support, as most of them
                            are made with cloth or thin rubber soles.</strong>
                        They’re generally made to keep your feet warm and look cute, but from an arch support
                        standpoint, most slippers are no different than going barefoot.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Going barefoot or wearing slippers may make your pain worse."
                        <cite>– University of Michigan Health System</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>After purchasing a stylish pair of slippers from her local Big Box Retailer, Phyllis was eager to
                        try them out when she got home. Much to her disappointment, the pain persisted, and she was
                        right back where she started.</p>
                    <p>“What if there was a slipper that had the footbed and arch support of a shoe?” she wondered to
                        herself.</p>

                    <h2>A Novel Solution</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.apexfoot.com/basis-slip-on/">The Basis™ Slip-On</a> was developed by Apex Foot Health for people just
                        like Phyllis.
                        Drawing on over 70 years of experience in the foot health industry, <strong>the doctors,
                            pedorthists and foot experts at Apex created the Basis by combining the footbed of a shoe,
                            the comfort of a pair of slippers and the simplicity of a sock.</strong></p>
                    <p>The result? The most comfortable, supportive house shoe on the market. But the Basis is so
                        much more than a comfortable house shoe. For those who have doctor-prescribed orthotic
                        inserts, whether it’s for diabetes or some other health concern, the Basis is a way to extend
                        their therapy and achieve better health outcomes.</p>

                <section class="content-wrap">
                    <p>When Phyllis found out about the Basis from a friend, she was intrigued – after all, it seemed
                        made specifically for people who had issues with foot pain. Not only did she like the fact that
                        it had the footbed of a shoe, she also liked that <strong>she could even remove the footbed
                            altogether
                            and replace it with the </strong><a href="https://www.apexfoot.com/a-wave-orthotic-support/">A-Wave</a><strong> orthotic inserts she
                            wears in her shoes during the day.</strong></p>
                    <p>Could these be the answer to her foot pain? Excited at the prospect, she ordered a pair. When
                        they arrived, she immediately opened the box and put them on. With the stretchy, breathable
                        material and oversized pull tabs, <strong>they slid on her foot as easily as a pair of
                            socks.</strong> After
                        walking around the house a little bit to test them out, her feet felt great and there was no
                        heel pain.</p>
                    <p>She felt relieved and finally able to relax as she sat down on her couch, kicking her feet up
                        on the cushions – something she never would have done while wearing her shoes.</p>
