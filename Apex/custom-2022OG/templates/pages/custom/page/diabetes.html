                    <h2>Why Orthopedic or Diabetic Footwear?</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="/foot-conditions/the-diabetic-foot-shoes/">diabetic foot</a> is uniquely at risk for injury, ulceration, infection…even partial and total amputation. That’s why wearing appropriately designed, great-fitting diabetic shoes is so vital for those suffering from diabetes. Apex diabetic shoes have been in the business of manufacturing and distributing the finest diabetic shoes available anywhere for nearly 50 years.</p>
                    <p>Throughout its history, Apex has designed and constructed its <a href="/foot-conditions/the-diabetic-foot-shoes/">diabetic shoes</a> specifically to protect and support diabetic feet. Today’s Apex footwear meets the highest standards of care for those suffering from diabetes and we take great pride in the contribution our company and our diabetic shoes have made to the steady decrease in diabetes-related amputations over the past few decades.</p>

                    <h3>Defense Against Foot Pain & Numbness</h3>
                    <p>Because polyneuropathy – the most common form of peripheral <a href="/foot-conditions/neuropathy-shoes/">neuropathy</a> – is the most common symptom of diabetes and prediabetes, excellence in manufacturing and materials are of critical importance. Apex manufacturing and materials are the finest in our industry. Polyneuropathy often causes numbness in the feet that makes it virtually impossible to feel the rubbing and related sores that cheaply-made shoes can cause. Those diabetic wounds can lead to infection and amputation.</p>

                    <p>Apex footwear has a minimum of 5/16” and as much as a full 1/2” of removeable depth in multiple layers making proper shoe fit a breeze. We also feature more widths to better accommodate our diabetic customers' needs and ensure that they receive great fitting shoes for even the hardest-to-fit diabetic feet.</p>

                    <p>With the exception of our <a href="/stretch-shoes/">Stretch</a> and <a href="/mens/best-selling-biomechanical-shoes">Conform</a> styles, all Apex shoes feature a soft, moisture-wicking lining with non-exposed seams that helps keep feet comfortable, dry and safe from irritation. In addition, Apex ‘Active’ and ‘Casual’ footwear styles feature strategically-placed padding and contoured insoles that provide optimal support, cushioning and shock absorption – essential features in protecting and pampering diabetic feet.</p>

                    <p>Apex <a href="/foot-conditions/the-diabetic-foot-shoes/">diabetic shoes</a> incorporate reinforced shanks for rearfoot stability. Higher, wider and reinforced toe boxes enable enough wiggle room for diabetic feet to avoid rubbing and dangerous irritation while still providing a feeling of gentle cradling within a firm foundation. Lastly, our anatomically-shaped lasts invite the foot to rest in the shoe more naturally.</p>

                    <p>We recommend bundling with our <a href="/copper-socks/">Copper Cloud</a> diabetic socks. We have more copper per square inch of material than any other sock out on the market. Copper provides antibacterial/ antifungal/ anti-order, and softer skin. Wearing these socks with your Apex shoes provides the ultimate solution in healing the pain caused by diabetic feet. We recommend white socks as this helps identify any bleeding commonly associated to diabetic feet.</p>
