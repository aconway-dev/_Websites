                    <p>Though many believe the way we fasten shoe closures has more to do with style than anything else, this isn’t always the case. Whether it’s traditional fabric laces, straps, bungee laces or something else entirely, each closure method brings unique benefits to the table. We take these benefits into account when we’re designing our shoes, so you have the best possible experience.</p>

                    <h3>Fabric Laces</h3>
                    <p>Fabric laces are the most common method of shoe closure, and for good reason: they provide more support than other
                        methods. Each crisscross of the shoelace over the tongue provides an additional point of support over the shoe opening,
                        and each eyelet the lace is threaded through provides an additional point of support for the uppers.</p>

                    <h3>Bungee Laces</h3>
                    <p>Unlike fabric laces, bungee laces are designed to stretch and relax as you move about. Though this provides additional
                        comfort, it means that the shoes aren’t quite as supportive as shoes with fabric laces. Additionally, bungee laces don’t
                        need to be tied – just tightened – making them almost as convenient as a pair of slip-ons.</p>

                    <h3>Pull-Back Strap &amp; D-Ring</h3>
                    <p>The benefit of this type of shoe fastener lies in its ease of use. Pull-back straps are ideal for those who are unable to tie
                        shoes, perhaps because they lack dexterity in their hands. The pull-back nature of the design allows the wearer to pull
                        back the strap to ensure a snug fit.</p>

                    <h3>Monk Strap</h3>
                    <p>Like pull-back straps, monk straps also have the advantage of being easy to fasten. Because they can’t be pulled back,
                        however, they can’t be tightened as snugly as pull-back straps. Though this may sound like a concern, it makes them
                        perfect for those looking for supreme comfort and ease of use.</p>

                    <h3>Strap &amp; Bungee</h3>
                    <p>The strap and bungee design combines the flexibility and comfort of bungee laces with an added adjustable strap at the
                        top of the shoe. This makes it ideal for shoes or boots in which high levels of comfort are desired but added stability and
                        support are necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Elastic Gussets</h3>
                    <p>Shoes with elastic gussets and elastic toplines offer the most ease in putting them on and taking them off. Essentially,
                        they’re similar to slip-on shoes in that they have no laces to be tied or straps to be fastened. They differ from slip-on
                        shoes, however, in that elastic is used to pull the tops of the shoes down tight across the foot to provide support.</p>
