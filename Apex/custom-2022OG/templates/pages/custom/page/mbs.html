                    <p>Footwear has long been considered a risk factor in falls. Ill-fitting shoes, shoes that don’t
                        provide an appropriate level of support or slip-resistance and shoes that are improperly worn
                        can increase the likelihood of a fall. In fact, <a href="https://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/08/45/8/pdf/Menant.pdf">a 2008 study</a> found that
                        <strong>"footwear has been
                            identified as a risk factor for both indoor and outdoor falls."</strong></p>
                    <p>The idea of getting a better
                        pair of shoes for her father intrigued Janice, so she started asking friends for suggestions.

                        bought a pair for
                        an elderly family member. <strong>Designed to mitigate the risk of falls by improving postural
                            stability, providing proprioceptive sensory feedback to the wearer and providing trip
                            avoidance

                    <p>Janice ordered a pair of Apex Balance Shoes for her father from <a href="/">Apex Foot Health Industries.</a>
                        Shortly after the shoes arrived, <strong>it became clear that the Apex Balance Shoe was a game-changer.</strong>
                        Her father felt confident and began going on morning walks again. He also started tending his
                        garden again, something he had given up because he was afraid of falling outside.</p>
