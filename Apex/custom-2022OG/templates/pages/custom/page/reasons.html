                    <h2>A Custom Fit</h2>
                    <p>Unlike regular shoes, diabetic footwear comes in full-sizes, half-sizes, and three different widths. They also offer adjustability with laces and hook and loop closure. That way, you can loosen and tighten your shoes depending on swelling or changes to your feet. Though brands like Sketchers may offer shoes that look similar, Apex shoes are customizable to suit bunions, hammertoes, and other foot irregularities.</p>

                    <h2>Extra Room</h2>
                    <p>Diabetic shoes have shoe inserts that, when removed, must provide at least 3/16 inch extra room or more. The added space reduces pressure on your foot, allowing for better circulation. This also leave room to add your own custom or prefabricated shoe inserts for even more comfort and support.</p>
                    <p>Compare that to leading brands, which offer no additional space and allow room for only the thinnest shoe inserts.</p>

                    <p>Apex footwear features high-quality materials like leather and wool. Apex shoes offer long-lasting uppers with sturdy rubber outsoles to keep you balanced and comfortable during a long walk.</p>
                    <p>Other brands cut corners by making their shoes with cheaper materials that can fall apart after a few months, whereas you can rest assured that our shoes will provide miles of comfort.</p>
