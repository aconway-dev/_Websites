                <h2>Apex Footwear is Simply the Best Choice</h2>
                <h3>Why Apex Footwear for Plantar Fasciitis?</h3>
                <p>People with plantar fasciitis have found relief wearing Apex footwear. Those with flat feet or
                    unusually high arches are the most prone to plantar fasciitis, which is caused from excessive
                    stretching of the arch. In either case, plantar fasciitis can be prevented or alleviated with
                    shoes that are designed to support the arch, control pronation and relieve excessive strain on
                    the plantar fascia. Apex footwear is designed to accommodate the unique needs of those who are
                    prone to plantar fasciitis, leading to unparalleled support and comfort.</p>

                    <h2>Preventing Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
                    <p>Generally, the best way to prevent plantar fasciitis is through proper footwear. Not
                        all footwear is built to accommodate your specific needs, and it’s easy to
                        mistakenly purchase the wrong kind of shoes. That’s why we recommend buying shoes
                        that are tailored to your needs and replacing them as soon as they wear out.</p>

                    <h2>Superior Fit & Removable Depth</h2>
                    <p>The foot is a three-dimensional object, but most shoes are only offered in sizes
                        based on one dimension: length. All Apex shoes are available in a variety of lengths
                        and widths to help you achieve the perfect fit. In addition, each shoe features a
                        minimum of 5/16” and up to 1/2" in removable depth to accommodate orthotic inserts.
