                                <p>Athletic shoes can be cleaned by hand-washing them with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For best results, clean your shoes immediately after exposure to mud or dirt. Allow shoes to air-dry at room temperature. It is important that you do not machine-wash or machine-dry your sneakers. For leather shoes, wipe shoes clean with a dry cloth. Apply a shoe cream to leather using a circular motion. For nubuck or suede, brush gently with a soft suede brush to remove stains or marks. For stubborn stains, use a suede eraser first, then brush gently with a suede brush.</p>
