                    <h1>How a Pair of Socks Changed One Woman's Life</h1>
                    <p>All Jane wanted to do was go to her grandchild’s college graduation. The only problem was that it was a four-hour plane ride away and she didn’t think she would be able to sit that long in airplane seat with her legs the way they were.</p>
                    <p><strong>Like many people her age, Jane was dealing with varicose veins.</strong></p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Varicose veins can occur in almost anyone and affect up to 35% of people in the United States."
                        <cite>-Dr. Eric Hager</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><strong>The aching, heavy feeling in her legs, the occasional burning, throbbing and muscle cramping</strong>, and the inability to sit or stand for long periods of time without pain were all keeping her on the sidelines – not just from seeing her grandchild graduate, but also from taking fun trips, going for long walks, and even going grocery shopping on some days.</p>
                    <h2>A Painful Problem in the Legs</h2>
                    <p>Jane's <a href="/blog/varicose-veins-explained/">varicose veins</a> started as spider veins, which first appeared in her late twenties during pregnancy. <strong>Slowly and over time, those spider veins turned into varicose veins.</strong> According to the Department of Health and Human Service's Office on Women's Health, the veins in our legs "have valves that act as one-way flaps. But if the valves don't close correctly, blood can leak back into the lower part of the vein rather than going toward the heart. Over time, <strong>more blood gets stuck in the vein</strong>, building pressure that weakens the walls of the vein," <strong>which causes the vein to swell and grow larger</strong>.</p>

                <section class="content-wrap">
                    <p><strong>For Jane, that meant aching, uncomfortable pain and fatigued legs</strong>. Because of symptoms like these, many people with varicose veins are hesitant to leave the house for too long since <strong>standing or sitting for long periods of time can make the symptoms worse</strong>. Why take a fun trip if you’re just going to spend your time worried about being able to find a place to sit and rest? Why take a long  trip if sitting in a car that long means you’ll be in too much pain to do anything once you reach your destination?</p>
                    <p>It was precisely because of concerns like these that kept Jane from grandchild’s graduation. A four-hour flight, not to mention all the standing around and waiting at an airport, seemed unbearable.</p>
                    <h2>A Non-Surgical, Non-Invasive Treatment</h2>
                    <p><strong>It was a friend that first mentioned the idea of wearing <a href="/compression-socks-hosiery/">compression hosiery</a></strong> to help relieve the symptoms of her varicose veins. Jane had seen others wearing compression socks before, but she figured it was because they had a medical condition like diabetes, or perhaps they were keeping their legs warm or liked the way they felt.</p>
                    <p>She decided to look into them.</p>
                    <p>Here’s how it works: imagine filling the plastic bag that a loaf of bread comes in with water. If you held the bag vertically, gravity would pull the water down, creating a bulge at the bottom of the bag. That’s essentially what happens with the veins in your legs as they begin to wear out – gravity pulls the blood down, resulting in swelling in the lower legs and visible varicose veins where blood is pooling.</p>
                    <p>Now imagine applying pressure to the bottom of the bag full of water where the bulge is. The pressure would push the water back up and allow the bag to maintain its original shape. Compression hosiery essentially works much the same way – <strong>the added pressure helps support the veins so they can function more efficiently and maintain their shape</strong>.</p>
                    <blockquote>"These stockings compress the veins and prevent blood from traveling down and pooling in the legs."<cite>-Dr. Eric S. Hager</cite></blockquote>
                    <p>And the science behind it checks out, too.</p>
                    <p>According to a study conducted on flight attendants, compression hosiery can lead to a significant improvement of discomfort from swelling, fatigue, aching, and tightness of the leg. An additional study found that "compression hosiery improves symptoms" and the efficiency of the veins among patients with varicose veins, while reducing swelling.</p>
                    <h2>The Answer Was a Pair of Socks</h2>
                    <p>After having researched compression hosiery, Jane was interested in trying out a pair of compression socks. <strong>They were very inexpensive compared to more drastic measures</strong> she may have taken, so she felt like she didn’t have much to lose.</p>
                    <p>She ordered a pair of knee-high <strong>Jēba Compression Socks from ApexFoot.com</strong>, where she also buys her shoes.</p>
                    <p>But she didn’t order any old pair of compression socks <strong>– she ordered gradient compression socks</strong>. These socks take the science behind gradient compression a step further by varying the level of compression – tighter around the foot and ankle, less so as you travel up the leg – so that <strong>the sock provides more support where you need it most.</strong></p>

                    <p>Gradient compression offers <strong>an innovative approach to compression hosiery</strong>. Since the force of gravity acting on the blood increases the further down the leg you go, it makes since to provide more support in those areas.</p>
                    <h2>Finally Free to Leave the House</h2>
                    <p>After receiving her gradient compression socks, Jane began wearing them from the moment she woke up until just before bedtime. <strong>The positive effects were quick and noticeable</strong>. Over the next couple of weeks, Jane’s confidence in venturing out of the house for long periods of time increased. She felt like <strong>she had regained her freedom and independence</strong> and was starting to feel like her old self again.</p>
                    <p>She could stand and walk for much longer periods of time before her legs started to ache, and she wasn’t easily fatigued like she was before. Spending her day running errands was no longer something she dreaded and the thought of going on a daylong shopping trip with her old friends felt like a real possibility again.</p>
                    <p>But most importantly, <strong>she felt ready to purchase tickets so she could see her grandchild graduate</strong>. With her compression socks, she wouldn’t have to worry about the pressure changes in their airplane causing pain, and she knew she would feel comfortable walking around the airports.</p>
