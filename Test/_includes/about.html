				<p>OHI is the global leader in technologies and treatment options for conditions associated with the lower extremities. OHI incorporates a global family of brands, including The Orthotic Group (TOG), Langer Biomechanics, Arizona Foot Orthotics, Apex Footwear and Australian Orthotic Group to name a few. In February 2016 OHI acquired Feet 24 7 and established a new company called OHI International in order to bring their products directly to the practitioner in Europe, enabling them to become more competitive and responsive in the market place.</p>
				<p>OHI International is dedicated to providing the highest level of clinical support and customer service. We are a small team headed by myself, a podiatrist with a PhD in biomechanics and 23 years experience in treatment, research and orthotics manufacture. We donâ€™t have a lot of employees, but we have a great team, and treat your business as our business. I look forward to working with you in the future and thank you for trusting us with your business in the past.</p>
				<p>Kind regards,</p>
